# Reimbeerse.py

A simple Python script that takes (1) the total restaurant bill and (2) the pre-tax/pre-tips total amount spent on food and alcohol and returns a total reimbursement amount that excludes the amount spent on alcohol and a proportional amount of the tax and tip. This is handy if you work for a company or agency that doesn't provide a flat-rate per diem. God forbid.
